# 4 pillars of OOP

# encapsulation
# wrap attribute and method in a class

# abstration
# hide away the details of the implementation, only expost what's necessary

# inheritance
# abstracting away the code that's shared , create unique attribute and method

# polymorphism
# share the same method name, generate different output due to different implementation
